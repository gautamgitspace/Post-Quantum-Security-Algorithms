# Overview
Post-Quantum safe Security Primitives for Constrained Devices
Comparative study of Lattice-based cryptographic algorithms and evaluating their performance by testing them on constrained device environment (Raspberry Pi B+). Programmed LP, U-LP, BLISS and NTRU algorithms in Python and C. 
Analyzed their 'Quantum Safe' performance by running the executables on a modern computer system and  on basic constrained device hardware.
